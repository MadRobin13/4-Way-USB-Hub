# Splittr
This is a custom-made USB-A splitter. It plugs into your laptop's USB-A port to split it 4 ways! My _inspiration_ for this project was the fact that whenever I was working with my **[FRC team](https://github.com/FRC1360)'s** robot, I could not directly interface with the control system with only 1 USB-A port on my laptop, so I made this splitter. The pcb and the case are completely my own **original design**. 

**_I hope this design is useful to people who do not have access to computers with more ports, and helpful as a project or tool to people trying to learn engineering. I also hope you like my designs!_ :)**

## How it works:

It plugs into 1 _USB-A_ port on your laptop, and then extends it to 4 _USB-A_ ports.

## How to get your own

Use the provided [gerber](Gerber.zip) in your chosen pcb manufacturer's ordering service.

## Case Assembly Instructions

_*You can find the case designs [here](https://www.printables.com/model/1052161-4-way-usb-a-splitter)._

- Put the pcb into the bottom half of the case and make sure it is secure.

- Plug the pegs into the top of the case so that they stick out the flat side. _(You may need to use pliers for this step.)_

- Plug the top half into the bottom half by aligning the ports on the bottom half with he pegs on the top half.

- Make sure to flatten out any pegs left up after both halves are connected.
